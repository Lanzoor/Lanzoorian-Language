# Known Issues and Bugs

## Known Issues on Android Devices

- For rare cases, the (monospace) font on Android devices might be different from what it is expected to do. Also, the IPA extensions unicode table is missing in the Android's version of monospace.
- Table font size changes and certain bold tags in tables doesn't work.

## Known Issues on iOS Devices

- The checkbox CSS does not work properly in most cases.
- You can't tap on elements to activate the `:hover` CSS, unlike Android. This may not be an issue.
- Again, table font size changes and certain bold tags in tables doesn't work.

## Known Issues on Laptop Devices

- ~~On some laptops / PC's and some OS's, the monospace font is different, and will display a different font. This mostly has things to do with what 'monospace' font the website is *trying* to deal with. This mostly happens with Windows 10.~~ **Fixed as of right now**
- Safari can't be used to connect to the website (if you're using Windows 10 or lower)
