# Known Issues and Bugs

## Known Issues on Android Devices

- For rare cases, the (monospace) font on Android devices might be different from what it is expected to do. Also, the IPA extensions unicode table is missing in the Android's version of monospace.
- Table font size changes and certain bold tags in tables doesn't work.

## Known Issues on iOS Devices

- The checkbox CSS does not work properly in most cases.
- You can't click to activate the `:hover` CSS, unlike Android. This may not be an issue.
- Again, table font size changes and certain bold tags in tables doesn't work.

## Known Issues on Laptop Devices

- On some laptops / PC's, the monospace font is not present, and will display a different font. This mostly has things to do with what 'monospace' font the website is *trying* to deal with.
